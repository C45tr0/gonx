// Reducer interface for Entries channel redure.
//
// Each Reduce method should accept input channel of Entries, do it's job and
// the result should be written to the output channel.
//
// It does not return values because usually it runs in a separate
// goroutine and it is handy to use channel for reduced data retrieval.

// the output channel.

// Redirect input Entries channel directly to the output without any
// modifications. It is useful when you want jast to read file fast
// using asynchronous with mapper routines.
